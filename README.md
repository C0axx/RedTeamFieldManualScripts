# Red Team Field Manual, latest edition useful commands

Disclaimer: Many of the commands REQUIRE you to input your own parameters. Do not use or run the scripts or batch files or ps1 files as is! Thats why they are not executable. Just "cat" or "type" the script and craft your own command

# Purpose

When taking the OSCP exam, you need to work FAST once you gained your initial foothold. Use the text contained within these shell scripts, powershell commands, and batch scripts as a REFERENCE for your purposes.

I highly recommend the "net" commands to help establish persistence.

For remote GUI access, please drop from /usr/share/windows-binaries both nc.exe and plink.exe to permit you to create remote SSH tunnels to enable remote access of RDP and to push additional payloads and stagers
